**polySegratioMM:** Bayesian mixture models for marker dosage in autopolyploids

Fits Bayesian mixture models to estimate marker dosage for dominant markers on autopolyploids using JAGS (1.0 or greater) as outlined in Baker et al (2010). May be used in conjunction with polySegratio for simulation studies and comparison with standard methods.

	Maintenance release: I am no longer working in polyploids.

**NB:** Migrated from r-forge to github for better project management
